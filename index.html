            <p>Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide. They formed the
                basis for
                the women's rights movement in the 19th century and the feminist movements during the 20th and 21st
                centuries.
                In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior,
                whereas
                in others, they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through
                claims of
                an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor
                of men
                and boys.[1]

                Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right to bodily integrity and
                autonomy, to
                be free from sexual violence, to vote, to hold public office, to enter into legal contracts, to have
                equal
                rights in family law, to work, to fair wages or equal pay, to have reproductive rights, to own property,
                and to
                education.</p>

            <p>Recognizing that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, as enshrined
                in
                the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
                is
                essential for the enjoyment of other human rights and freedoms, and constitutes a fundamental pillar for
                building a democratic society and strengthening democracy, bearing in mind that all human rights are
                universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated</p>
